# *2020 Follow-up: Improving Image Fidelity on Astronomical Data*

## AIM

This is a follow-up of the
[DC2019](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2019/1179/info.php3?wsid=1179&venue=Oort)
workshop, and a sprint to make progress on the [Github](https://github.com/teuben/dc2019) page.
A lot of work has already been done, which should not be lost or forgotten, and some final coordination is needed to close out the [manuscript](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d829641216025000191a049).

Specific goals are (to be discussed with team):
* Return to [manuscript](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d829641216025000191a049) draft, **before July 29**
* Develop specific tasks for each team, **July 29-31** 
* Share data/scripts, and test methods, **July 31-August 24**
* Develop publicly sharable code, **before August 24**
* Final hack-a-thon, **August 24-28**
* Robust manuscript draft, **end of August**

## FORMAT

We will dedicate two ''work weeks'' on July 29-31; and again August 24-28.  In between, we will meet every Thursday (06/08/20, 13/08/20, 20/08/20).

*Our Zoom meetings will be held at UTC 11-13.*  These are mornings in the US (~7:00-9:00 EDT; 5:00 MT); afternoon in Europe (13:00-15:00); and night in Japan (20:00-22:00) and in Australia (21:00-23:00).

#### WEEK 1 (Aug 3-7):  - see also:  https://github.com/teuben/dc2019/issues

- [x]  Make the "sky model" with a few point sources.  Notify the group when it's ready. [[AI: Peter/Dirk ]] - **See: skymodel-a.fits**
- [ ]  Determine common observing setup for the TP/7m/12m simulated observations, and send feedback to Toshi about the simulated data setup. [[AI: Devaky]]
- [ ]  Generate the simulated observations of the skymodel-a (from Peter/Dirk) [[AI: Toshi/Yusuke]]
- [ ]  Wednesday: Suggest colormap possibilities to vote. [[AI: All]]
- [ ]  Friday: Vote on colormap for observational images.  [[AI: All]]
- [ ]  Weekly meeting on Thursday @ UTC 11-12 (any additional discussion from 12-13).

#### WEEK 2 (Aug 10-14):

- [ ]  First half of week: Define the details of the TCLEAN method [[AI: Dirk]]
- [ ]  Run combinations on simulated observations [[AI: Methods teams]]
- [ ]  Provide scripts for combination methods.  [[AI: Methods teams]]
- [ ]  Weekly meeting on Thursday @ UTC 11-12 (any additional discussion from 12-13).

## By Aug.17: Datasets needed for QA [[AI: Methods teams]]
For each DC method we need:
* Initial Skymodel
* TP map
* Final combined (TP+ACA+12m) map at it highest resolution
* Intermediate products (if created): i.e. TP+ACA only map
* Format: either FITS or CASA images

#### WEEK 3 (Aug 17-21):

- [ ]  Assessment [[AI: Alvaro]]
- [ ]  Select a colormap for assessment plots [[AI: Alvaro]]
- [ ]  Run combination methods on observational datasets [[AI: Dataset teams]]
- [ ]  Weekly meeting on Thursday @ UTC 11-12 (any additional discussion from 12-13).

#### WEEK 4 (Aug 24-28), *Work Week #2*:

- [ ] Daily meetings @ UTC 11-13.
